SCP-096 is to be contained in its cell, a 5 meters airtight steel cube, at all times. Weekly checks for any cracks or holes are mandatory. There are to be absolutely no video surveillance or optical tools of any kind inside SCP-096's cell.

SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition.

SCP-096 is normally extremely docile. However, when someone views SCP-096’s face, whether directly or via video or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress. Approximately one to two minutes after viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who saw its face. This reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and universal.

No known material or method can obstruct SCP-096 once it has begun. Upon reaching its target, SCP-096 will kill them in a violent outburst. Afterwards, it will sit down for several minutes before regaining composure and becoming docile again.

Due to this, it is considered extremely dangerous to capture SCP-096’s appearance in any form.

Do not look at its face.
